# Culture & Values

What's it like to work at Folio?

# We're remote first

Our team is primarily remote, and distributed across timezones - Pacific, Central, Eastern and Pakistan.

Being all remote has a bunch of advantages:

- We can hire amazing people from anywhere.
- It encourages thoughtful, and intentional, written communication
- It creates space for lots of uninterrupted work.
- We have to judge performance based on real outcomes, not hours spent in an office.

# We give feedback early and often

Everyone should help everyone else raise their game.

We are direct about the quality of work. That doesn't always mean work needs to be completely polished, as it depends on the speed and impact of a task. Being great at giving and receiving feedback is a key part of our culture.

# We're biased for action

If given a choice, go live. If you can't go live, reduce the task size so you can.

We are small, and can only win based on speed and agility. Everyone at Folio has the autonomy to make decisions and execute on their ideas.

Going live forces a level of completion, on which you can build.

Default to not asking for permission to do something if you are acting in the best interests of Folio. It is ok to ask for more context though.

# We're scrappy

Always start with the 20:80 solution. Ask yourself "How can I do 20% of the work to get 80% of the value?". Be hacky. Be scrappy. Be creative. Be fast.

As we grow, we will encounter times when we need to build scalable systems. Even then, ask what’s the 20% of scaling work we need now. We’ll do the other 80% of the work over time.
