# Offsites

While we have set up the company to work asynchronously as much as possible, there's a very real benefit in getting together in real life.

Our best ideas come from working together, so we try to strive for meeting up regularly. Our schedule may look like:

- Twice a year: all-company offsite
- Occasionally: in-person onboarding
- Whenever you like: in-person meetups
