# Communication

## Introduction

With team members across timezones, it's important for us to practice clear communication in ways that help us stay connected and work more efficiently.

To accomplish this, we use asynchronous communication as a starting point and stay as open and transparent as we can.

## Our communication values

1. **Assume positive intent.** Always coming from a position of positivity and grace.
2. **Form an opinion.** We live in different locations and often have very different perspectives. We want to know your thoughts, opinions, and feelings on things.
3. **Feedback is essential.** Help everyone up their game in a direct but constructive way.

## Golden rules

- It is 100% OK to ask as many questions as you have - please ask in public channels! If someone sends you a handbook link, that means they are proud that we have the answer documented - they don't mean that you should have found that yourself or that this is the complete answer. If the answer to a question isn't documented yet please immediately make a pull request to add it to the [handbook](https://github.com/folioworks/folio-docs) in a place you have looked for it.
- When someone asks for something, reply back with a deadline or by noting that you already did it. Answers like: 'will do', 'OK', or 'it is on my todo list' are not helpful. If it is a small task for you but will unblock someone else, consider spending a few minutes to do the task so the other person can move forward.
- By default, avoid creating private groups for internal discussions.
- Use asynchronous communication when possible: Lienar comments on projects or issues. Announcements happen on the appropriate Slack channels and people should be able to do their work without getting interrupted by chat.
