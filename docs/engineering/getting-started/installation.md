# Installation

## Step 1. Get access to the tools

Make sure you get started by logging in to your company provided email address (should be yourname@folio.works).

Your Google account/email should already have granted you access to all the tools we use:

- Slack - For talking to each other
- Linear - For figuring out what to do next, and staying organized
- Zoom - Also for talking to each other but better?
- Notion - For stuff that isn't documented here (going away soon hopefully)

The one thing you won't have created for you is a Github account. Either sign up for one yourself, or use your existing Github account. Slack your github account to Pratik, and he'll get you added to our Github organization.

## Step 2. Setup the Folio web app

First step is to clone the [Folio web app repo](https://github.com/folioworks/folio-web).

```
git clone git@github.com:folioworks/folio-web.git
```

This is the primary repo we use for developing the Folio web app. There are others, you can feel free to browse them, but this is the "main" one.

Once you've cloned the repo, use an editor of your choice to open up the codebase. We don't have any "required" editors, but we HIGHLY recommend using either Cursor, VSCode or a VSCode derivative. All of our project settings and configurations are pre-created for VSCode, so you'll get a head start on staying organized if you use it.

Take a look at the [README](https://github.com/folioworks/folio-web/blob/develop/README.md) file to get started with the rest of setup for the Folio web app.

## Where to find documentation

For code we tend to document things where it leaves. This might be a README file in the folder you're looking at which contains instructions for setup and anything else you may need to know.

"How to work" related docs will exist here on the docs site.
